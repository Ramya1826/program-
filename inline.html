    <p style="color:brown">I sit in my room late at night, staring at the computer screen, I decide it would be a good idea to 
    create this text. There isn't much meaning to it, other than to get some simple practice. A lot of the 
    texts that have been created are rather short, and don't give a good representation of actual typing speed
     and accuracy. They lack the length to gauge where your strengths and weaknesses are when typing.</p>
     <p style="color:red">Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly,
     cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, but that's not for me
      to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?</p>
