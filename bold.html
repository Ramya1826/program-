    <p><b>Honesty</b> is the practice of speaking and acting truthfully and
     with integrity, and it is essential to building <i>trust and respect
      in our relationships</i>. Whether it's being honest with ourselves
      and others about our thoughts and feelings, admitting our
       mistakes and shortcomings, or <strong>communicating clearly and 
       transparently</strong>, honesty can create a sense of authenticity 
       and connection in our interactions with others.</p>
